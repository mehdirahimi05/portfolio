            <h3>Hi - My Name is Mehdi Rahimi</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="contest_text">
            <p>I’m 19 years old and based in Erfurt, Germany. I was born in Afghanistan and moved to Germany at a young
                age, carrying with me both the resilience shaped by my past and the ambition to create my future. My
                story is one of constant adaptation — learning a new language, building new connections, and finding my
                place in a world completely different from where I started.
                <br>
                I study computer science, learn fast, and build on natural talent with hard work. I’m curious, focused,
                and always pushing forward — not just to get better, but to do things right. <br> I care about
                character. Respect, discipline, and honesty guide how I learn, work, and
                interact. My
                time in sports has taught me that both the mind and the body need discipline, patience, and consistent
                effort to truly grow. <br>
                This site shows who I am, what I do, and what I stand for. It’s not just a portfolio — it’s a reflection
                of my journey, my skills, and the mindset that drives me. I believe in pushing limits, embracing
                challenges, and never settling for “good enough” when I know I can do better.

                    <p><strong>Brain</strong> – For me, the mind is the starting point of everything. A sharp and
                        disciplined mind can
                        turn obstacles into opportunities. I believe in staying curious, questioning what I hear, and
                        always looking for a deeper understanding. With
                        focus, patience, and the will to adapt, the mind becomes the strongest tool we have.</p>

                <div class="body_text">
                    <p><strong>Body</strong> – Strength is more than muscle; it’s discipline, consistency, and respect
                        for your limits. I
                        believe in taking care of my body through training, movement, and a healthy lifestyle. A strong
                        body supports a strong mind, and every drop of sweat is an investment in resilience and
                        self-control.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spirit</strong> – For me, nothing is more important than my faith in Islam. It shapes my
                        values, guides my
                        actions, and keeps me grounded no matter where life takes me. My faith is my source of strength,
                        peace, and purpose — the foundation upon which everything else in my life is built.</p>
