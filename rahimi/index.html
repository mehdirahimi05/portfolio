                <p>I study computer science, learn fast, and build on natural talent with hard work. I’m curious,
                    focused,
                    and always pushing forward — not just to get better, but to do things right.
                </p>
                <p>I care about character. <br> Respect, discipline, and honesty guide how I learn, work, and
                    interact.
                    Kickboxing keeps me grounded — it reminds me that strength means nothing without control.</p>
                <p>This site shows who I am, what I do, and what I stand for.</p>

                <div class="brain_text">
                    <p><strong>Brain</strong> – For me, the mind is the starting point of everything. A sharp and
                        disciplined mind can
                        turn obstacles into opportunities. I believe in staying curious, questioning what I hear, and
                        always looking for a deeper understanding. Life will always throw challenges at us, but with
                        focus, patience, and the will to adapt, the mind becomes the strongest tool we have.</p>

                <div class="body_text">
                    <p><strong>Body</strong> – Strength is more than muscle; it’s discipline, consistency, and respect
                        for your limits. I
                        believe in taking care of my body through training, movement, and a healthy lifestyle. A strong
                        body supports a strong mind, and every drop of sweat is an investment in resilience and
                        self-control.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spirit</strong> – For me, nothing is more important than my faith in Islam. It shapes my
                        values, guides my
                        actions, and keeps me grounded no matter where life takes me. My faith is my source of strength,
                        peace, and purpose — the foundation upon which everything else in my life is built.</p>
