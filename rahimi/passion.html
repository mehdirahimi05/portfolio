                <h3>My Passions and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Outside of my studies, I live a life full of movement, curiosity, and creativity. Kickboxing is a big
                    part of who I am — it pushes my limits, keeps me disciplined, and sharpens my mind as much as my
                    body. Alongside that, I train in strength sports, always challenging myself to become stronger and
                    more resilient.</p>

                <p>I’ve always been drawn to stories — not just modern ones, but old tales that carry history, wisdom,
                    and culture. I enjoy spending time in nature, finding peace and clarity away from screens and noise.
                    Science fiction films and series fascinate me because they mix imagination with the possibilities of
                    science — a combination that inspires my own thinking.</p>

                <p>Physics is another passion of mine. Even though I chose computer science as my field of study, I
                    continue to explore physics with genuine interest. Sports have been part of my life since childhood
                    — I played football for eight years, winning the Thuringia Championship, an achievement that taught
                    me teamwork, perseverance, and dedication.</p>

                <p>For me, hobbies are more than free-time activities. They’re part of my personal growth, shaping the
                    way I think, act, and face challenges.</p>
