                <h3>My Education – Learning Without Limits</h3>
            </div>
            <p>When I arrived in Germany, everything was new — the language, the culture, the school system. I started
                in 5th grade, but only for two months. My teachers quickly noticed how fast I learned and decided to
                move me directly to 6th grade. That year, I received the award for the best student in my class — a
                moment that proved to me that hard work pays off, even in a completely new environment.
            </p>
            <p>From there, I completed my Realschule with strong results and a growing confidence in my abilities.
                Education became more than just schoolwork — it was my way of proving to myself that I could adapt,
                learn, and excel, no matter the circumstances.</p>
            <p>After Realschule, I moved on to the vocational high school Andreas Gordon in Erfurt to pursue my Abitur.
                The pace was faster, the expectations higher, and for the first time, I faced moments where my
                motivation slipped. But those years taught me something important: consistency matters more than short
                bursts of effort.</p>
                <img src="img/abi.jpeg" alt="abi_pic" class="education_img">
            <p>Now I’m studying computer science at the University of Applied Sciences in Erfurt — currently in my 2nd
                semester, soon entering my 3rd. Throughout my education, I was often among the top students in my class,
                not because I was the smartest, but because I refused to give up.
            </p>
            <img src="img/uni.jpg" alt="uni_pic" class="education_img">
            <p>My path in education has been shaped by discipline, curiosity, and the belief that learning never stops.
                Every step — from my first day in a German classroom to my current university lectures — has prepared me
                for the challenges ahead. This is not the end of my education, but just another chapter in a journey
                that will continue for the rest of my life.</p>
